# Introduction 
Codebase created from a series of YourTube videos on building out a Dynamic Platform using the latest technologies including C#, ASP.NET, MVC, Azure, SQL, CosmosDb and more.

When complete the platform will provide you with a base for building your own applications.  We'll also use the project to explore various development practices and technologies such as ASP.NET MVC, Angular, Single Page Apps, Azure, AWS, Microservices and DevOps.
